# RegamaTools

### An equivalent of [KogamaTools](https://https://github.com/Beckowl/KogamaTools) for Regama.

**This project is still a work in progress/proof of concept. Currently, it has no interface and is just a collection of QOL features.**

# Features:
- Removes the build limit;
- Makes the game window resizable;
- Adds the "No Texture" material to the materials menu;
- Unlocks destructible materials in model editing;
- Material picking with the middle mouse button;
- Hides the cursor when inserting or translating objects;
- Adds the `Q` hotkey for cloning

# How to install:
- Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Beckowl/RegamaTools/releases/latest)
- Press `windows + r` and paste the following into the `Run` window and press enter:
```
%localappdata%\Regama\Game
```
- Extract the zip you downloaded previously into that folder.

If you make an interface for this before I do, feel free to open a PR.
